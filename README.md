# Music_Generation
I Thank MIT for providing the materials and workspace to understand and practice Recurrent Neural Network with the help of TENSORFLOW framework and using KERAS API.I decided to upload my works on creating a Music Generation after attending their lectures and working in lab sessions. This code mainly focuses on creating new Musics . I have mentioned the link to their lectures and lab sessions which will be extermely usefull .
Perquisites to understand the code

Basic knowledge in:

•	Recuurent Neural Networks 

•	TensorFlow 

•	Keras and

•	Python
